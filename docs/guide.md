# rhun guide

rhun draws everything itself: it rasterizes TrueType fonts, icons and widgets into a pixel buffer and hands that buffer to the display server. On Linux it speaks the Wayland and X11 wire protocols directly, without libc, toolkits or libwayland. On macOS the same code runs natively on Apple silicon in an AppKit window. The result is one binary (fonts, themes and grammars included) that looks the same on every desktop.

## Features

- Tabs, file explorer, command palette, fuzzy file finder, find and replace, find in files, go to line
- Image preview: PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, ICO, QOI, PNM and TGA open in a tab, with zoom and pan
- Syntax highlighting for about 125 languages, defined in plain text grammar files
- 39 color themes, dark and light, with a match for every Omarchy theme; add your own
- Settings page and a readable config file, both applied while running
- Agents panel: Claude Code and Codex sessions of the project, updated live as the agent works
- Terminal panel: shells with 24-bit color, mouse, scrollback and full-screen programs
- Git: changed lines in the gutter, file status in tabs and the explorer, diffs, and a history of all branches drawn as a graph
- Undo and redo, auto-indent, bracket pairs, comment toggling, moving and duplicating lines, soft word wrap
- Vim mode, off by default: normal, insert and visual modes, operators, text objects, counts, `.`, search and `:` commands
- Characters missing from the built-in fonts are drawn with the system's fonts
- Every XKB layout, dead keys and the Compose key (the system's Compose rules, `~/.XCompose` or `$XCOMPOSEFILE`)
- Files changed on disk are reloaded, open files are restored per project
- Wayland with fractional scaling; X11 as a fallback
- macOS on Apple silicon: Retina displays, input methods and dead keys, full screen, signed with a Developer ID
- Installs with one command and updates itself from GitHub releases

## Install and update

```sh
curl -fsSL https://github.com/vshvedov/rhun/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
wget -qO- https://github.com/vshvedov/rhun/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh   # without curl
```

The installer needs no root. It checks the download against the release's SHA-256 checksums, and on macOS also that the app is signed by rhun's developer.

- Linux: `~/.local/bin/rhun`, the desktop entry in `~/.local/share/applications` (it starts rhun by its full path) and the icons in `~/.local/share/icons/hicolor`; the desktop's menu and icon caches are refreshed.
- macOS: `rhun.app` in `/Applications` (`~/Applications` when that is not writable), and a `rhun` command in `~/.local/bin`.
- So that `rhun` starts from any terminal, every shell you use gets that `bin` folder on its PATH, in a block marked `# rhun`: your login shell, `$SHELL`, and each shell with a configuration in your home folder (zsh `.zshrc`, bash `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`, sh, dash and ksh `.profile`, fish `conf.d/rhun.fish`, nushell `env.nu`, tcsh `.tcshrc`). The lines check PATH first, so nothing is added twice.

Options go after `sh -s --`, as in `curl -fsSL .../install.sh | sh -s -- --version 0.14.0`:

| Option | |
| --- | --- |
| `--version X` | install X instead of the latest release |
| `--prefix DIR` | Linux: install under DIR instead of `~/.local` |
| `--app-dir DIR` | macOS: put rhun.app in DIR |
| `--no-modify-path` | leave shell startup files alone |
| `--uninstall` | remove rhun and the PATH line; your settings in `~/.config/rhun` stay |

rhun looks for a new version a few seconds after it starts and once a day while it runs. The check is one HTTPS request to github.com for a small text file, made with curl (or wget) in the background, so it never slows rhun down. When there is a newer version, the status bar shows **Update to X**: clicking it installs the update in the background, and **Restart to update** then restarts rhun into it, asking about unsaved files first and reopening the project. Check for Updates, Install Update and Restart to Update are in the command palette too.

**Check for updates** in Settings (`check = false` under `[updates]`) turns the automatic check off; **Check now** below it still works. A rhun built from source checks only when asked and never replaces itself.

## Build

Run the commands below from the repository root.

Linux on x86-64 needs GNU as and ld (binutils). macOS on Apple silicon needs the Xcode command line tools (`xcode-select --install`).

```sh
./build.sh           # build/rhun with debug symbols (and build/rhun.app on macOS)
./build.sh release   # stripped
tests/run.sh         # unit tests and scripted UI tests
tools/install.sh     # release build into ~/.local, with the desktop entry and icon;
                     # on macOS rhun.app into /Applications and the rhun command into ~/.local/bin
```

### macOS

rhun is written in x86-64 assembly, and the sources stay the one description of the editor. On macOS `tools/arm64.py` translates them to AArch64 at build time, instruction by instruction: x86 registers live in fixed AArch64 registers, the x86 stack keeps its layout, and flags are computed only where they are read. `src/mac/` holds what is native to the Mac: the process entry, the Linux system calls rhun makes, carried out on libSystem, file watching on FSEvents, and the AppKit window, which shows each frame through an IOSurface. The tests pass on both systems. `tests/compare-linux.sh` checks the translation itself: it runs random editing sessions (`tests/fuzz.py`) in the Linux binary under Docker and in a translated one built from the same sources for Linux, and compares states, documents and screenshots, which must be identical.

A release for distribution outside the App Store is signed with a Developer ID and the hardened runtime, notarized by Apple and packed in a disk image:

```sh
xcrun notarytool store-credentials rhun-notary --apple-id YOUR_APPLE_ID --team-id TEAM_ID   # once
tools/package-mac.sh   # build/rhun-VERSION-macos-arm64.zip and .dmg
```

`RHUN_SIGN_ID` picks another signing identity. `RHUN_NOTARIZE=0` signs without notarizing and makes no disk image: macOS opens an app downloaded in a browser only when Apple has notarized it, while `install.sh` and updates download with curl, which needs only the signature. `tools/mac-icon.py` draws `assets/icons/rhun.icns` from the Linux icon, `tools/png-icons.py` the PNG icons for Linux.

### Releases

`VERSION` holds the version. `tools/release.sh 0.14.0` writes it, commits, tags `v0.14.0` and pushes; the tag starts `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which tests and builds both systems, signs the Mac app, and publishes the release with the archives, `SHA256SUMS`, `VERSION` and `install.sh`. The release stays a draft until everything is uploaded, so rhun and the installer never see a version without its files. A version with a dash (`0.14.0-rc1`) is published as a prerelease, which they do not take for the latest.

The workflow needs five repository secrets: `MACOS_CERT_P12` and `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD` (the Developer ID Application certificate with its key, exported as .p12, base64), and `APPLE_API_KEY_P8`, `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` and `APPLE_API_ISSUER_ID` (an App Store Connect API key for notarization, the .p8 in base64). The Mac app is notarized, and the release gets a disk image, only when the repository variable `RHUN_NOTARIZE` is `1` (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables); otherwise the release does not wait on Apple.

`tests/update.sh` runs rhun's updater against a fake release folder, and `tests/install.sh` the installer; `RHUN_RELEASES_URL` points both at another place for the releases.

## Run

```sh
rhun [folder] [files...]
```

Without a folder the current directory is the project. Without files the previous session of that project is reopened.

Started from a terminal, rhun goes on by itself: the prompt comes back at once, and closing the terminal leaves rhun open. `rhun --wait` stays until rhun is closed, which is what programs that wait for an editor need, such as git: `export EDITOR="rhun --wait"`.

rhun uses Wayland when it can and falls back to X11 when there is no Wayland compositor. `RHUN_BACKEND=x11` or `RHUN_BACKEND=wayland` picks one.

The mouse pointer is the desktop's: the compositor draws it when it supports the cursor-shape protocol; otherwise rhun loads your Xcursor theme (`XCURSOR_THEME`, `XCURSOR_SIZE`, `~/.icons/default`, `/usr/share/icons/default`).

On Wayland rhun draws its own title bar with window buttons, except on tiling compositors (Hyprland, Sway, niri, river, dwl, Qtile), where windows stay bare. `decorations = auto | client | server` under `[ui]` overrides this; `client` is rhun's title bar, `server` is the compositor's.

On macOS the title bar is rhun's too, with the window buttons in it. Command works as Ctrl (and so does Control), Option as Alt; Command with the arrows goes to the line or document ends and Option with the arrows and Backspace works by words, as elsewhere on the Mac. Option still types its characters where it has no binding, and input methods and dead keys work as in any Mac app. On a layout that is not Latin, shortcuts use the key's letter. Started from Finder or the Dock, rhun opens your home folder; files and folders can be opened with it from Finder. In the terminal Command copies, pastes and runs rhun's shortcuts while Control types control characters; Control+\` toggles the terminal, as Command+\` belongs to the system. The shell starts as a login shell, as in Terminal.

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+P | Go to file |
| Ctrl+Shift+P, F1 | Command palette |
| Ctrl+, | Settings |
| Ctrl+K | Color theme |
| Ctrl+B | Toggle explorer |
| Ctrl+Shift+A | Toggle agents panel |
| Ctrl+\` | Toggle terminal |
| Ctrl+Shift+\` | New terminal |
| Ctrl+Shift+G | Toggle git history |
| Ctrl+F, Ctrl+H | Find, replace |
| Ctrl+Shift+F | Find in files |
| Ctrl+G | Go to line |
| Ctrl+D | Select word, then next match |
| Ctrl+/ | Toggle comment |
| Alt+Z | Toggle word wrap |
| Alt+Up, Alt+Down | Move lines |
| Ctrl+Shift+D, Ctrl+Shift+K | Duplicate, delete line |
| Ctrl+Tab, Ctrl+W | Next tab, close tab |

All commands are listed in the command palette. In the terminal, Ctrl+Shift+C and Ctrl+Shift+V copy and paste, Shift+PageUp and Shift+PageDown scroll back, and Shift keeps the mouse for selecting when a program uses it.

### Git

In a git repository rhun shows what changed since the last commit. It runs the `git` program in the background, so the editor never waits for it, and follows commits, checkouts and edits made elsewhere, the built-in terminal included.

- The gutter marks added lines green and changed lines amber, and points to deleted lines in red. The marks follow the text as you type, before it is saved.
- File names in tabs and the explorer take the color of their status. The explorer adds a letter: M modified, A added, U untracked, D deleted, R renamed, C conflict; folders take the color of the changes inside them.
- Git: Open Changes (also in the explorer's context menu of a changed file) opens the file's diff against HEAD in a read-only tab, with the old and new line numbers and the file's syntax colors.
- The history (Ctrl+Shift+G, or the branch button in the title bar) shows the latest 3000 commits of all branches as a graph, with branch and tag names. The first row holds the uncommitted changes. The selected commit's message and changed files are shown on the right, with lines added and deleted; clicking a file opens its diff in that commit.

It stays quick on large repositories: the Linux kernel's history (1.5M commits, 96k files) opens in about a tenth of a second.

Git support is on by default; `enabled = false` under `[git]` in the config, or the Git switch in Settings, turns it off.

### Images

PNG, JPEG (baseline and progressive, EXIF orientation applied), GIF (first frame), BMP, ICO / CUR, QOI, PNM (PBM, PGM, PPM) and TGA open in an image tab; other binary files are not opened. An image is decoded when its tab is first shown and fits the view without being enlarged; transparent parts show a checkerboard. It is decoded again when the file changes on disk.

| Key / mouse | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl+=, Ctrl+-, `+`, `-` | Zoom in, out (stops at 100% on the way) |
| Ctrl+0, `0` | Fit to the view |
| `1`, double click | 100%; double click again to fit |
| Ctrl+wheel | Zoom at the pointer |
| Wheel, drag, arrows | Pan |

The status bar shows the size, the file size, the format and the zoom; clicking the zoom switches between fit and 100%.

### Vim mode

The Vim mode switch in Settings (`vim_mode = true` under `[editor]`) or Toggle Vim Mode in the command palette turns it on. The status bar shows the mode and the keys typed so far; outside insert mode the cursor is a block.

- Normal, insert, visual and visual line mode. Esc or Ctrl+[ goes back to normal mode.
- Motions: `h j k l`, `w b e W B E`, `0 ^ $ _ + -`, `gg G`, `f F t T ; ,`, `%`, `{ }`, `H M L`, `n N * #`, with counts. Ctrl+D and Ctrl+U move half a page; `zz zt zb` scroll.
- Operators `d c y > < gu gU g~` take a motion or a text object: `iw aw iW aW`, quotes (`i" a'` and ``i` ``) and brackets (`i( a) ib i{ aB i[ i<`). Doubled (`dd`, `>>`, `gUU`) they work on lines.
- `x X D C s S Y J r ~ p P u` Ctrl+R `.`, and `i a I A o O` with counts (`3ihi`).
- `/` and `?` search from the command line in the status bar, going to the first match as you type; Enter stays there, Esc goes back, `n` and `N` repeat it. They are motions too (`d/foo`, `v?bar`). The text is found as typed, not as a regular expression, and case matters only when the find bar's Aa is on. `*` and `#` find the word under the cursor as a whole word.
- `:` opens a command line in the status bar: `:w :q :q! :wq :x :wa :qa :qa! :e path :e! :noh`, and `:N` goes to line N.
- Yanks and deletes go to the clipboard. `p` puts text copied in other programs too, as whole lines when it ends with a newline.
- A mouse selection is a visual selection. Keys bound to commands (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+P, ...) keep working, except Ctrl+R, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+U and Ctrl+[ outside insert mode.

Registers, marks, macros, ranges and `:s`, visual block and replace mode are not there.

## Configuration

`~/.config/rhun/config` is written when you change something in Settings; Open Settings File creates it. Edits to the file apply as soon as it is saved.

```ini
[ui]
theme = tokyo-night
scale = 1.25
[editor]
font_size = 15
tab_width = 4
[terminal]
shell = /usr/bin/fish
[git]
enabled = false
[keys]
ctrl+shift+d = duplicate_line
alt+z = none
```

Key names are those of the command palette entries in snake case (see `src/app/keys.s`). `none` removes a binding.

### Themes

A theme is a `name.theme` file in `~/.config/rhun/themes/`. Colors not given are derived from `bg`, `fg` and `accent`, so a theme can be three lines. See `runtime/themes/` for all keys.

```ini
name = My Theme
kind = dark
bg = #1e1e2e
fg = #cdd6f4
accent = #f5c2e7
keyword = #cba6f7
string = #a6e3a1
```

Under `[terminal]` a theme can set the 16 terminal colors, `black` to `bright_white`; the ones not given come from the theme's other colors. `git_added`, `git_modified` and `git_deleted` color changes in the gutter, tabs, explorer and diffs.

On Omarchy the theme list starts with Follow Omarchy (`theme = omarchy`): rhun uses the theme Omarchy has set and switches with it. It is the default there until you pick another theme. For an Omarchy theme rhun has no match for, add a rhun theme with the same name; otherwise rhun's own dark or light theme is used.

### Languages

Built-in languages: Ada, Apache, AppleScript, AsciiDoc, Assembly, Astro, AWK, Batch, BibTeX, Blade, C, C#, C++, Cap'n Proto, Clojure, CMake, COBOL, Crontab, Crystal, CSS, CUDA, CUE, D, Dart, Dhall, Diff, Dockerfile, dotenv, EJS, Elixir, Elm, ERB, Erlang, F#, Fish, Fortran, Git attributes, Git Commit, Gleam, GLSL, Go, GraphQL, Graphviz, Groovy, HAML, Handlebars, Haskell, Haxe, HCL, HTML, HTTP, Idris, Ignore, INI, Janet, Java, JavaScript, Jinja, JSON, Jsonnet, Julia, Just, KDL, Kotlin, LaTeX, Lean, Liquid, Lua, Makefile, Markdown, MATLAB, Mermaid, Meson, Mojo, Nginx, Nim, Ninja, Nix, Objective-C, OCaml, Odin, Org, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Pkl, PlantUML, PowerShell, Prisma, Prolog, Properties, Protocol Buffers, Pug, Puppet, PureScript, Python, R, Raku, Razor, Rego, reStructuredText, RON, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Shell, Slim, Solidity, SQL, SSH config, Starlark, Swift, Tcl, Thrift, TOML, Twig, TypeScript, Typst, V, Vala, Verilog, VHDL, Vim script, Visual Basic, XML, YAML, Zig.

A grammar is a `name.syn` file in `~/.config/rhun/syntax/`; user grammars take precedence over built-in ones.

```ini
name = Example
files = *.ex Examplefile
first_line = example
comment = //
block = /* */
string = " \
mstring = """ \
region = <% %> preproc multiline
line = # heading
keywords = if else while return
types = int str
constants = true false
builtins = print
prefix = $v @a #p
ident = -
captypes = yes
case = insensitive
```

`comment`, `block`, `string` and `mstring` are shorthands for `region = start end class [multiline] [bol] [escape=X]`. Classes: text keyword type function string number comment constant operator punctuation preproc variable builtin attribute tag heading inserted deleted escape link. Words not in a list are colored as functions when followed by `(`, and with `captypes` as types when capitalized.

`prefix` lists characters that start a colored word, each followed by a letter: `v` variable, `a` attribute, `t` tag, `p` preproc (at the start of a line only). A file gets the grammar whose `files` fit its name best: an exact name first, then the longest `*.suffix`; your grammars win a tie. Only when no pattern fits does rhun look for a `first_line` word in the file's first line.

## Scripting

`rhun --control /path/to/socket` accepts one command per line, and `rhun --headless 1280x800 --script file` runs a file of them without a display. The tests use this.

```
open src/main.s
key ctrl+g
type 40
key Return
cmd toggle_comment
shot /tmp/rhun.ppm
print-state
```

Commands: `key`, `type`, `click x y [right|middle]`, `move`, `down`, `up`, `scroll dy [ctrl]`, `open`, `cmd`, `shot`, `wait`, `wait-git`, `wait-update`, `resize`, `print-doc`, `print-state`, `print-term`, `print-git`, `print-gitlog`, `print-update`, `print-frames`, `echo`, `quit`. `cmd` runs anything from the command palette by its snake case name.

## Extensions (planned)

Extensions will be separate programs, in any language, that talk to rhun over the control socket. rhun starts each one found in `~/.config/rhun/extensions/` and passes the socket path in `RHUN_SOCKET`. Two additions to the protocol cover most needs:

- `register name title [keys]` adds a command to the palette; invoking it sends `run name` back to the extension.
- `subscribe open save change cursor` streams events as lines (`saved /path/file.c`), so formatters, linters and language servers can run outside the editor.

An extension that crashes or hangs cannot take the editor with it.
